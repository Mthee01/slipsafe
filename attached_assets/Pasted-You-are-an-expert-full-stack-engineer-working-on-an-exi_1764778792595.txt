You are an expert full-stack engineer working on an existing Replit project called SlipSafe.

## 1. Context

- The app is already working with:
  - Login screen (Welcome to SlipSafe, Username/Password, etc.)
  - Backend auth and receipt/claims functionality.
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript (likely with Vite), Node/Express backend, and existing PWA support (or at least a basic manifest/service worker that we can extend).
- Goal: ADD a **public marketing / landing page** that:
  - Sits at the root (`/`).
  - Gives an overview of SlipSafe.
  - Explains products for Individuals, SMMEs, and Retailers.
  - Shows simple pricing.
  - Provides clear help/contact options.
  - Includes a live chat widget.
  - Includes a **hard-coded dummy user count / usage stat** to create social proof.
- Additionally: ensure that **when the app is installed or added to the home screen**, it displays the **SlipSafe logo as the icon** (PWA icon + favicon + iOS home screen icon).
- The existing login/signup experience must remain working and be linked from the landing page.

Before changing anything, scan the repo and **identify the current routes and components for:**
- Sign in / login
- Create account / register
Then use those actual paths when wiring links and buttons (do NOT invent new routes if the app already has them).

---

## 2. Routing Requirements

1. Make the **new landing page** the default for visitors to `/`.
2. Keep the existing authenticated app as-is under its current route(s). If the login page is currently served from `/`, refactor so:
   - `/` → new Landing/Home page
   - `/login` (or existing login route) → login screen
   - `/register` or `/create-account` (whatever exists) → registration screen
3. Update navigation and buttons to point to the **actual** login and registration routes in the codebase.

If necessary, create a simple React router setup (if not already present) and a central layout component.

---

## 3. Navigation Bar

Add a top navigation bar that appears on the landing page:

- Left: SlipSafe logo (use the existing SlipSafe logo asset in the project).
- Center/Right nav links (scroll to sections on the same page):
  - Home → scroll to top
  - How it works → `#how-it-works`
  - For Individuals → `#for-individuals`
  - For Businesses → `#for-businesses`
  - For Retailers → `#for-retailers`
  - Pricing → `#pricing`
  - Help → `#help`
- Right-side buttons:
  - **Sign In** → link to the EXISTING login route (e.g. `/login` or whatever the project uses).
  - **Get Started Free** → link to the EXISTING registration / create-account route.

Use the existing colour scheme that matches the SlipSafe login screen (blue primary) and keep the nav sticky at the top on scroll.

---

## 4. Hero Section (top of the landing page) + Dummy User Count

Place this at the top of the landing page:

**Headline:**
> Never lose a slip again.

**Sub-heading:**
> SlipSafe turns paper and email receipts into smart, searchable records – with returns, warranties and VAT-ready reports all in one secure app.

**Buttons:**
- **Get Started Free** → registration route.
- **View Business Plans** → scroll to `#pricing`.

Below the buttons, add:

1. A **trust strip** with short text tags:
   - “Secure storage”
   - “Smart return & warranty deadlines”
   - “Accountant-ready exports for SMMEs”

2. A **dummy social proof metric** (hard-coded for now) such as:
   - “Join over **1 250** shoppers and businesses already protecting their slips with SlipSafe.”
   Implement this as a simple front-end constant (e.g. `const DUMMY_USER_COUNT = 1250;`) so it is easy to replace later.

On the right side of the hero, show a graphic or component using existing UI:
- A mockup of the login screen and/or a sample receipts/warranty view, styled to look like it’s inside a laptop or phone frame.

---

## 5. Main Audiences Section

Add a section with id `#audiences` under the hero.

Section title:
> Built for real-life receipts – not just perfect systems.

Three cards/columns with these EXACT headline lines:

1. **Everyday Shoppers**  
   “For shoppers who are tired of lost, faded receipts and missing warranties – SlipSafe keeps every slip and guarantee safe, searchable and ready when you need it.”

2. **SMMEs**  
   “For SMMEs who need VAT and spending under control – SlipSafe turns everyday slips into clean, accountant-ready reports.”

3. **Merchants & Retailers**  
   “For retailers drowning in paper slips, disputes and fraud – SlipSafe turns receipts into verifiable digital records, speeding up returns and unlocking real post-purchase insight.”

Add 1–2 short supporting bullets per card, but keep the main lines exactly as above.

---

## 6. “How SlipSafe Works” Section

Add a section with id `how-it-works`.

Title:
> Three simple steps

Show three steps with icons:

1. **Capture your receipt**  
   “Scan with your phone camera, upload a photo or paste an email receipt.”

2. **SlipSafe reads and organises it**  
   “Our OCR extracts totals, dates, VAT and return/warranty terms, then files everything by merchant, category and date.”

3. **Use it when it counts**  
   “Show digital proof at the till, track ‘Return by’ and ‘Warranty ends’ dates, export reports or generate verifiable claims.”

---

## 7. For Individuals Section

Section id: `for-individuals`.

Title:
> For Individuals: No more shoeboxes, no more faded slips.

Bullets:

- Keep **all your personal receipts** in one secure place.  
- Get **smart reminders** before returns and warranties expire.  
- Store **proof of purchase** for big-ticket items without worrying about paper.  
- Free to use – forever.

CTA button:
- **Get Started Free** → registration route.

---

## 8. For SMMEs Section

Section id: `for-businesses`.

Title:
> For SMMEs: VAT, spend and evidence in one place.

Bullets:

- Separate **Business** and **Personal** profiles with their own dashboards.  
- Capture business expenses from anywhere – owner or staff can upload slips.  
- Get **VAT and expenditure summaries** by month, merchant and category.  
- Export **accountant-ready CSV/PDF reports** for tax and year-end.  
- Track return and warranty deadlines on equipment, tools and stock.

CTA button:
- **See Business Plans** → scroll to `#pricing`.

---

## 9. For Merchants & Retailers Section

Section id: `for-retailers`.

Title:
> For Retailers: Faster returns, less fraud, clearer insight.

Short intro paragraph:
> SlipSafe gives retailers a digital layer over traditional receipts, making returns, warranties and claims faster and more reliable – without forcing a full POS replacement on day one.

Bullets:

- **Reduce friction at the returns desk** – staff rely on clear, digital proof instead of deciphering faded paper slips.  
- **Cut down on fraud and “friendly fraud”** – verifiable digital receipts and claims make re-used or manipulated slips much harder.  
- **Apply policies consistently** – standardise how return and warranty rules are applied across categories, promotions and branches.  
- **See the post-purchase journey** – gain visibility into returns and claims by customer, category and SKU instead of losing insight once the slip leaves the store.

CTA button:
- **Talk to us about a pilot** → scrolling to `#help` is fine, or open a mailto (see Help section below).

---

## 10. Pricing Section

Section id: `pricing`.

Title:
> Simple, transparent pricing

Subheading:
> Start free as a shopper. Upgrade to business plans when you’re ready.

Create three pricing cards plus an Enterprise note.

### Card 1 – SlipSafe Free – Individuals
- **R0 / month**
- Unlimited personal receipts

### Enterprise note

Below the cards, add a small block:

> **SlipSafe Enterprise (Custom)**

---

## 11. Help & Contact Section

Section id: `help`.

Title:
> Need help? We’re close by.

Create four contact blocks and ensure the links are clickable:

1. **WhatsApp Support**
   - Text: “Chat with SlipSafe on WhatsApp”
   - Phone: **083 678 4884**
   - Button or link:
     - Use this exact link:  
       `https://wa.me/27836784884?text=Hi%20SlipSafe%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20your%20app.`
     - Open in a new tab.

2. **Email**
   - Label: “Email us”
   - Address: **sales@slip-safe.net**
   - Clickable link:
     - `mailto:sales@slip-safe.net`

3. **Phone**
   - Label: “Call us”
   - Number: **083 678 4884**
   - Clickable link:
     - `tel:+27836784884`
   - Small note: “Business hours: Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00 (SAST)”

4. **Live Chat**
   - Text: “Use the live chat bubble at the bottom of the screen to message us instantly from the website.”

---

## 12. Live Chat Widget

Integrate a simple third-party chat widget (Crisp or Tawk.to is fine; choose one).

Example with Crisp:

- Add the Crisp JavaScript snippet to the main HTML template or root React layout so it loads on all pages.
- Use a placeholder `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` env var or a test ID; the real one will be configured later.
- Ensure it shows as a floating chat bubble in the bottom-right corner on the landing page and login/register screens.

The only requirement: the chat bubble should be visible and functional (able to send basic messages) without breaking the app.

---

## 13. Footer

Add a footer visible on the landing page, with:

- Links (anchor or routes):
  - Home → `/`
  - Pricing → `#pricing`
  - Help → `#help`
  - Terms & Conditions → create/link a simple `/terms` page placeholder
  - Privacy Policy → create/link a simple `/privacy` page placeholder
- Contact line:
  - “Contact: sales@slip-safe.net · 083 678 4884”
- Copyright:
  - “© SlipSafe. All rights reserved. Made in South Africa.”

---

## 14. PWA Icon & SlipSafe Logo (Add-to-Home-Screen & Install)

Ensure that when the app is installed or added to the home screen (as a PWA), it uses the **SlipSafe logo** as the icon.

1. **Locate the SlipSafe logo asset** in the project (or, if needed, create/export square PNG versions of the logo at multiple resolutions: 192x192, 256x256, 384x384, 512x512 pixels).

2. Place the icons in a logical public path, e.g.:
   - `/public/icons/slipsafe-192.png`
   - `/public/icons/slipsafe-256.png`
   - `/public/icons/slipsafe-384.png`
   - `/public/icons/slipsafe-512.png`

3. Update or create the **Web App Manifest** (e.g. `manifest.json` or `manifest.webmanifest`) to include:
   - `"name": "SlipSafe"`
   - `"short_name": "SlipSafe"`
   - `"start_url": "/"`
   - `"display": "standalone"`
   - `"background_color": "#ffffff"` (or existing)
   - `"theme_color":` set to the primary SlipSafe blue
   - `"icons":` array with the logo icons, for example:
     ```json
     "icons": [
       {
         "src": "/icons/slipsafe-192.png",
         "sizes": "192x192",
         "type": "image/png"
       },
       {
         "src": "/icons/slipsafe-256.png",
         "sizes": "256x256",
         "type": "image/png"
       },
       {
         "src": "/icons/slipsafe-384.png",
         "sizes": "384x384",
         "type": "image/png"
       },
       {
         "src": "/icons/slipsafe-512.png",
         "sizes": "512x512",
         "type": "image/png"
       }
     ]
     ```

4. In the main HTML file (e.g. `index.html` for Vite/React), ensure:
   - The manifest is linked:
     ```html
     <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />
     ```
   - There is a favicon that also uses the SlipSafe logo (e.g. `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/icons/slipsafe-192.png" />`).
   - For iOS add-to-home-screen support, also add:
     ```html
     <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/slipsafe-192.png" />
     ```
   - `meta name="theme-color"` is set to the SlipSafe brand colour.

5. Confirm in the browser:
   - The PWA manifest loads correctly (check Application/Manifest tab in browser dev tools).
   - Adding the app to the home screen on mobile and installing as a PWA in desktop Chrome shows the SlipSafe logo as the icon.

---

## 15. Implementation Notes

- Use the existing colour palette and typography so the landing page matches the login screen style.
- Use responsive, mobile-first layout (Tailwind or existing CSS). Ensure sections stack neatly on small screens.
- Implement the **dummy user count** as a simple front-end constant in the hero section.
- Do not break any existing authentication or receipt functionality.
- After all changes:
  - Ensure all nav links and buttons work:
    - Section anchors scroll correctly.
    - Sign In and Create Account/Registration go to the existing auth routes.
    - WhatsApp, mailto, and tel links open correctly.
  - Confirm the app builds and runs without TypeScript or bundler errors.
  - Confirm the SlipSafe logo appears as the app icon when the PWA is installed or added to the home screen.

Now implement this new landing/home page, routing updates, dummy user count, contact links (with sales@slip-safe.net), live chat, and PWA icon configuration in the current SlipSafe Replit project.

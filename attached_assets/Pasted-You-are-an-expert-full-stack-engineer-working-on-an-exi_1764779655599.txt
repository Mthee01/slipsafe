You are an expert full-stack engineer working on an existing Replit project called SlipSafe.

## 1. Context

- The app is already working with:
  - Login screen (Welcome to SlipSafe, Username/Password, etc.)
  - Backend auth and receipt/claims functionality.
  - An EXISTING **Pricing section/page** for SlipSafe plans (do NOT rebuild it, just integrate with it).
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript (likely with Vite), Node/Express backend, and existing PWA support (or at least a basic manifest/service worker that we can extend).

## 2. Goal

Add a **public marketing / landing page** that:

- Sits at the root (`/`).
- Gives an overview of SlipSafe.
- Explains offerings for:
  - Individuals (free personal use),
  - SMMEs (Business 1 / Business Team),
  - Merchants & Retailers (pilot/POC).
- Integrates cleanly with the **existing Pricing section/page** (no duplication).
- Shows clear help/contact options.
- Includes a live chat widget.
- Includes a **hard-coded dummy user count** for social proof.
- Ensures that when the app is installed or added to the home screen, the **SlipSafe logo** is used as the app icon.

The existing login/signup flows and the existing pricing section must remain working and be linked from the landing page.

Before changing anything, scan the repo and **identify**:

- Current routes/components for:
  - Sign in / login
  - Register / create account
- The existing **Pricing page or component**:
  - Its route (e.g. `/pricing`) OR
  - Its section id (e.g. a `#pricing` section on the same page)

Use those actual paths/ids instead of inventing new ones.

---

## 3. Routing Requirements

1. Make the **new landing page** the default for visitors to `/`.
2. Keep the existing authenticated app as-is under its current routes.
3. If the login page is currently at `/`, refactor so:
   - `/` → new Landing/Home page
   - `/login` (or existing login route) → login screen
   - `/register` or `/create-account` → registration screen (if present).
4. The existing **Pricing section** should stay where it is:
   - If it’s a separate page (e.g. `/pricing`), landing page buttons should navigate there.
   - If it’s a section on the same page with an id (e.g. `id="pricing"`), landing page links should scroll to that anchor.

Do not duplicate or rebuild the pricing cards; only integrate.

---

## 4. Navigation Bar

Add a top navigation bar on the landing page:

- Left: SlipSafe logo (use the existing SlipSafe logo asset).
- Center/Right nav links:
  - Home → scroll to top
  - How it works → `#how-it-works`
  - For Individuals → `#for-individuals`
  - For Businesses → `#for-businesses`
  - For Retailers → `#for-retailers`
  - Pricing → **link to the existing pricing section/page**:
    - If pricing is on a dedicated route (e.g. `/pricing`), use that.
    - If pricing is on the same page with `id="pricing"`, use `#pricing`.
  - Help → `#help`
- Right-side buttons:
  - **Sign In** → link to the existing login route (e.g. `/login`).
  - **Get Started Free** → link to the existing registration / create-account route.

Use the existing colour scheme that matches the SlipSafe login screen and keep the nav sticky on scroll.

---

## 5. Hero Section + Dummy User Count

At the top of the landing page:

**Headline:**
> Never lose a slip again.

**Sub-heading:**
> SlipSafe turns paper and email receipts into smart, searchable records – with returns, warranties and VAT-ready reports all in one secure app.

**Buttons:**

- **Get Started Free** → registration route.
- **View Business Plans** → integrate with the existing pricing section:
  - If pricing is a separate page: navigate to `/pricing`.
  - If pricing is on the same page: scroll to `#pricing`.

Below the buttons, add:

1. **Trust strip** with short tags:
   - “Secure storage”
   - “Smart return & warranty deadlines”
   - “Accountant-ready exports for SMMEs”

2. **Dummy social proof** (hard-coded constant), e.g.:
   - “Join over **1 250** shoppers and businesses already protecting their slips with SlipSafe.”
   Implement as a front-end constant, e.g. `const DUMMY_USER_COUNT = 1250;` so it can be swapped later.

Right side of hero: show a visual using existing UI:
- A mockup of the login or dashboard view in a device frame (desktop or mobile style).

---

## 6. Main Audiences Section

Add a section beneath hero (id `audiences` or just placed logically).

Title:
> Built for real-life receipts – not just perfect systems.

Three audience cards with these exact lines:

1. **Everyday Shoppers**  
   “For shoppers who are tired of lost, faded receipts and missing warranties – SlipSafe keeps every slip and guarantee safe, searchable and ready when you need it.”

2. **SMMEs**  
   “For SMMEs who need VAT and spending under control – SlipSafe turns everyday slips into clean, accountant-ready reports.”

3. **Merchants & Retailers**  
   “For retailers drowning in paper slips, disputes and fraud – SlipSafe turns receipts into verifiable digital records, speeding up returns and unlocking real post-purchase insight.”

Add 1–2 small supporting bullets or icons per card.

---

## 7. “How SlipSafe Works” Section

Section id: `how-it-works`.

Title:
> Three simple steps

Three steps with icons:

1. **Capture your receipt**  
   “Scan with your phone camera, upload a photo or paste an email receipt.”

2. **SlipSafe reads and organises it**  
   “Our OCR extracts totals, dates, VAT and return/warranty terms, then files everything by merchant, category and date.”

3. **Use it when it counts**  
   “Show digital proof at the till, track ‘Return by’ and ‘Warranty ends’ dates, export reports or generate verifiable claims.”

---

## 8. For Individuals Section

Section id: `for-individuals`.

Title:
> For Individuals: No more shoeboxes, no more faded slips.

Bullets:

- Keep **all your personal receipts** in one secure place.  
- Get **smart reminders** before returns and warranties expire.  
- Store **proof of purchase** for big-ticket items without worrying about paper.  
- Free to use – forever.

Button:
- **Get Started Free** → registration route.

---

## 9. For SMMEs Section

Section id: `for-businesses`.

Title:
> For SMMEs: VAT, spend and evidence in one place.

Bullets:

- Separate **Business** and **Personal** profiles with their own dashboards.  
- Capture business expenses from anywhere – owner or staff can upload slips.  
- Get **VAT and expenditure summaries** by month, merchant and category.  
- Export **accountant-ready CSV/PDF reports** for tax and year-end.  
- Track return and warranty deadlines on equipment, tools and stock.

Button:
- **See Business Plans** → reuse the existing pricing section/page:
  - If pricing is at `/pricing`: navigate there.
  - If pricing is on the same page: scroll to `#pricing`.

---

## 10. For Merchants & Retailers Section

Section id: `for-retailers`.

Title:
> For Retailers: Faster returns, less fraud, clearer insight.

Intro:
> SlipSafe gives retailers a digital layer over traditional receipts, making returns, warranties and claims faster and more reliable – without forcing a full POS replacement on day one.

Bullets:

- **Reduce friction at the returns desk** – staff rely on clear, digital proof instead of deciphering faded paper slips.  
- **Cut down on fraud and “friendly fraud”** – verifiable digital receipts and claims make re-used or manipulated slips much harder.  
- **Apply policies consistently** – standardise how return and warranty rules are applied across categories, promotions and branches.  
- **See the post-purchase journey** – gain visibility into returns and claims by customer, category and SKU instead of losing insight once the slip leaves the store.

Button:
- **Talk to us about a pilot** → scroll to `#help` or open mailto (see Help section).

---

## 11. Pricing Integration

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT REBUILD THE PRICING UI.**

- Detect where the existing Pricing section lives:
  - If it is a dedicated route (e.g. `/pricing` with a React page), then:
    - All “Pricing” nav links and “View Business Plans” / “See Business Plans” buttons should route to `/pricing`.
  - If the pricing UI is part of the same SPA view with an element like `<section id="pricing">`:
    - Use hash/anchor linking to scroll to `#pricing` from:
      - The nav “Pricing” link,
      - “View Business Plans” button in Hero,
      - “See Business Plans” button in SMME section.

The goal: from the landing page, users should smoothly reach the **already-built pricing section** via these links/buttons.

---

## 12. Help & Contact Section

Section id: `help`.

Title:
> Need help? We’re close by.

Create four contact blocks with working links:

1. **WhatsApp Support**
   - Text: “Chat with SlipSafe on WhatsApp”
   - Phone: 083 678 4884
   - Link (open in new tab):
     `https://wa.me/27836784884?text=Hi%20SlipSafe%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20your%20app.`

2. **Email**
   - Label: “Email us”
   - Address: `sales@slip-safe.net`
   - Link: `mailto:sales@slip-safe.net`

3. **Phone**
   - Label: “Call us”
   - Number: 083 678 4884
   - Link: `tel:+27836784884`
   - Note: “Business hours: Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00 (SAST)”

4. **Live Chat**
   - Text: “Use the live chat bubble at the bottom of the screen to message us instantly from the website.”

---

## 13. Live Chat Widget

Add a third-party live chat widget (Crisp or Tawk.to recommended).

Example with Crisp:

- Add the Crisp JavaScript snippet to the main HTML or top-level React layout so it appears on:
  - Landing page
  - Login page
  - Pricing page
- Use a placeholder `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` (I’ll configure the real one later).
- Ensure a floating chat bubble appears bottom-right and basic messaging works.

---

## 14. Footer

Add a footer visible on the landing page:

- Links:
  - Home → `/`
  - Pricing → existing pricing route or `#pricing`
  - Help → `#help`
  - Terms & Conditions → simple `/terms` page placeholder (if not already present)
  - Privacy Policy → simple `/privacy` page placeholder (if not already present)
- Contact line:
  - `Contact: sales@slip-safe.net · 083 678 4884`
- Copyright:
  - `© SlipSafe. All rights reserved. Made in South Africa.`

---

## 15. PWA Icon & SlipSafe Logo (Add-to-Home-Screen & Install)

Ensure that when the app is installed or added to the home screen, it uses the **SlipSafe logo**:

1. Locate existing SlipSafe logo, or create square PNG versions (192x192, 256x256, 384x384, 512x512).
2. Place them under a public path, e.g. `/public/icons/`.
3. Create/update `manifest.webmanifest` (or `manifest.json`) with:
   - `"name": "SlipSafe"`
   - `"short_name": "SlipSafe"`
   - `"start_url": "/"`
   - `"display": "standalone"`
   - `"background_color": "#ffffff"`
   - `"theme_color"`: SlipSafe primary blue
   - `"icons"`: array of the SlipSafe logo sizes
4. In `index.html`:
   - Link manifest:
     `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />`
   - Set favicon:
     `<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/icons/slipsafe-192.png" />`
   - Apple touch icon:
     `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/slipsafe-192.png" />`
   - Theme color meta tag:
     `<meta name="theme-color" content="#[SlipSafe blue]" />`
5. Confirm via browser dev tools that the manifest is valid and that install/add-to-home-screen uses the SlipSafe logo.

## 16. Implementation Notes

- Use existing styles/colours so the landing page feels consistent with the app.
- Make everything responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Implement the dummy user count as a constant in the hero.
- Do NOT remove or break the existing pricing UI; only link into it.
- After changes:
  - Verify:
    - Nav links scroll or route correctly.
    - Sign In and Get Started Free go to the correct auth routes.
    - Pricing-related buttons hit the existing pricing section/page.
    - WhatsApp, mailto, and tel links work.
    - PWA install uses the SlipSafe logo.
  - Ensure the app builds and runs without TypeScript or bundling errors.

Now implement this new landing/home page, integrate it with the existing pricing section, and configure contact, chat, and PWA icons in the current SlipSafe project.

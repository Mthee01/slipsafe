You are an expert full-stack and front-end engineer working on an existing Replit project called SlipSafe.

## 1. Context

- The app already has:
  - Working auth (login/register).
  - Core receipt/claims functionality.
  - An existing **Pricing** section/page (do NOT rebuild, only integrate).
  - A basic landing page created earlier (currently dull; we want to visually upgrade it).
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript (likely Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion available, Node/Express backend, PWA support.

## 2. Goal

Take the **current landing page implementation** and upgrade it to be:

- **Lively, attractive, and interactive**, not static or dull.
- Using a **retractable navigation sidebar** for the landing page (desktop + mobile friendly).
- Rich in **visuals**: stock-style images of **diverse people/groups** and relevant artifacts/objects, wired in as `<img>` placeholders with proper alt text and classes.
- Lightly animated: smooth **entrance transitions, hover effects, and a playful user count animation**.
- Still integrated correctly with:
  - Existing auth routes (Sign In / Register).
  - Existing Pricing page/section.
  - Existing contact info and PWA icon setup.
  - Dummy user count for social proof.

Do NOT break any existing logic; we are mostly enhancing layout and UI.

---

## 3. Navigation – Retractable Sidebar (Landing Page Only)

Replace or augment the current top nav on the landing page with a **retractable navigation sidebar**:

### 3.1 Behaviour

- The sidebar is used on the **landing page** (route `/`) only.  
  Do NOT change any nav inside the authenticated app/dashboard unless it’s clearly shared and safe.

- Desktop:
  - Left-aligned vertical sidebar that can collapse/expand.
  - Default state: expanded (shows icons + labels).
  - Collapse on click of a toggle button (e.g. chevron icon) to show icons only.
- Mobile:
  - Sidebar hidden by default.
  - Show a **hamburger button** at the top (e.g. fixed top-left or top-right).
  - Tapping the hamburger opens a sliding drawer sidebar from the left.
  - Tapping outside or on a link closes it.

### 3.2 Sidebar Content

Sidebar should include:

- SlipSafe logo at the top.
- Navigation items (these can scroll to anchors or go to routes):

  - Home → scroll to top.
  - How it works → `#how-it-works`.
  - For Individuals → `#for-individuals`.
  - For Businesses → `#for-businesses`.
  - For Retailers → `#for-retailers`.
  - Pricing → **link to existing pricing**:
    - If pricing is on a route like `/pricing`, link there.
    - If pricing is on the same page, scroll to `#pricing`.
  - Help → `#help`.

- At the bottom of the sidebar:
  - Buttons or links:
    - **Sign In** → existing login route (e.g. `/login`).
    - **Get Started Free** → existing register route.

Use Tailwind + icons (e.g. Lucide or similar) and add hover states (background highlight + slight scale).

**Sidebar Icons (artifacts):**

Use a consistent line icon style (Lucide/Feather/Heroicons):

- Home → house icon  
- How it works → play/steps icon  
- For Individuals → single user icon  
- For Businesses → briefcase or 3-people icon  
- For Retailers → shopping cart / barcode icon  
- Pricing → price tag / credit card icon  
- Help → chat bubble / question mark icon  

---

## 4. Hero Section – More Visual, Animated, with User Count

Refine the current hero section to be more dynamic:

**Content (keep base text but make it lively):**

- Headline:
  > Never lose a slip again.

- Sub-heading:
  > SlipSafe turns paper and email receipts into smart, searchable records – with returns, warranties and VAT-ready reports all in one secure app.

- Buttons:
  - **Get Started Free** → registration.
  - **View Business Plans** → existing pricing page/section.

### 4.1 Visuals (Hero Image + Objects)

Use a **large background or side image** showing diverse people shopping or using a phone app.

- Example stock-style URL (placeholder in `<img src="">`):
  - `https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184465/pexels-photo-3184465.jpeg`  
    (diverse group in a modern setting)
- Place this image on the right with a soft gradient overlay so hero text remains readable.

**Recommended AI image prompt for hero (for designer/external tool):**

> “A diverse group of shoppers in a modern supermarket, smiling and looking at a smartphone screen together. Bright lighting, clean retail shelves in the background, subtle bokeh, professional lifestyle photography style.”

**Hero overlay objects/icons:**

- Phone screen mockup showing:
  - Digital receipt
  - “Return by 15 Jan”
  - “Warranty ends 15 Dec”
- Small receipt icon and shield/check icon around the hero area.

### 4.2 Dummy user count (animated)

- Implement a constant:  
  `const DUMMY_USER_COUNT = 1250;`
- Display text near the hero buttons, e.g.:

  > Join over **1 250** shoppers and businesses already protecting their slips with SlipSafe.

- Animate the number counting up from 0 to 1250 using Framer Motion or `useEffect` + `setInterval`:
  - Smooth, quick animation when the hero mounts.

### 4.3 Animations

Use Framer Motion on:

- Hero heading + sub-heading:
  - Fade in + slight upward motion.
- Buttons:
  - Slight scale/opacity on load.

Tailwind hover effects for CTAs, e.g.:

- `hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg transition`

## 5. Main Audiences – With Imagery & Motion

Keep the **three audience statements** exactly but enhance layout and visuals.

### 5.1 Section Settings

- Section title:
  > Built for real-life receipts – not just perfect systems.

- Use a grid of three cards, each with:
  - An image.
  - Title.
  - Short statement.
  - Small decorative objects/icons.

### 5.2 Text (keep exactly):

1. **Everyday Shoppers**  
   “For shoppers who are tired of lost, faded receipts and missing warranties – SlipSafe keeps every slip and guarantee safe, searchable and ready when you need it.”

2. **SMMEs**  
   “For SMMEs who need VAT and spending under control – SlipSafe turns everyday slips into clean, accountant-ready reports.”

3. **Merchants & Retailers**  
   “For retailers drowning in paper slips, disputes and fraud – SlipSafe turns receipts into verifiable digital records, speeding up returns and unlocking real post-purchase insight.”

### 5.3 Images (stock-style, diverse) + prompts

Use `<img>` tags with responsive classes and meaningful alt text, and point them to real URLs or placeholder URLs. For example:

- **Everyday Shoppers**  
  - Example image URL:  
    `https://images.pexels.com/photos/3965552/pexels-photo-3965552.jpeg`  
  - Alt: “Young shoppers looking at a smartphone while shopping.”
  - AI prompt (for designer/external tool):  
    > “A Black woman in casual clothes sitting at a kitchen table, checking a paper receipt while looking at her smartphone, warm natural light, cozy home background, lifestyle photography.”

- **SMMEs**  
  - Example image URL:  
    `https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184291/pexels-photo-3184291.jpeg`  
  - Alt: “Small business owner working on a laptop with receipts and a calculator.”
  - AI prompt:  
    > “A small business owner and her team in a cosy office, working on a laptop with scattered receipts and a calculator on the table. Charts on a screen in the background. Professional yet relaxed, diverse team, modern style.”

- **Merchants & Retailers**  
  - Example image URL:  
    `https://images.pexels.com/photos/5632371/pexels-photo-5632371.jpeg`  
  - Alt: “Retail cashier assisting a customer at checkout.”
  - AI prompt:  
    > “A supermarket customer service desk where a customer holds a boxed appliance while a cashier scans a receipt at the computer. Modern store interior, focus on the interaction.”

### 5.4 Audience card objects & animations

- Everyday Shoppers:
  - Faded receipt icon in the corner.
  - Calendar/clock icon indicating return deadlines.
- SMMEs:
  - VAT badge (e.g. “VAT 15%”), small bar/pie chart.
- Merchants & Retailers:
  - POS terminal + tiny digital receipt with QR code.
  - Shield/lock icon to suggest fraud reduction.

**Animations & interactions:**

- Use Framer Motion to animate each card on scroll (fade + slight scale or slide).
- Hover effects using Tailwind:
  - `hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105 transition`

---

## 6. “How SlipSafe Works” – Add Visual Objects

Section id: `how-it-works`.

Keep the three-step content, but:

- Use a horizontal or vertical layout with icons/illustrations for each step.
- Each step is a card with title, description, and an object image/icon.

### 6.1 Steps (text)

1. **Capture your receipt**  
   “Scan with your phone camera, upload a photo or paste an email receipt.”

2. **SlipSafe reads and organises it**  
   “Our OCR extracts totals, dates, VAT and return/warranty terms, then files everything by merchant, category and date.”

3. **Use it when it counts**  
   “Show digital proof at the till, track ‘Return by’ and ‘Warranty ends’ dates, export reports or generate verifiable claims.”

### 6.2 Icons / image prompts per step

- **Step 1 – Capture:**
  - Illustration/icon: smartphone with camera frame over a paper receipt.
  - AI prompt:  
    > “Flat vector illustration of a smartphone camera scanning a paper receipt, with a rectangular focus frame and sparkles around it, on a white background, minimal blue accent.”

- **Step 2 – OCR & organise:**
  - Illustration/icon: laptop screen showing a simple table of receipts and category tags.
  - AI prompt:  
    > “Flat vector illustration of a laptop screen showing a simple table of receipts and colorful category tags, with floating icons for VAT, calendar, and pie chart, minimal fintech style, blue and purple accents.”

- **Step 3 – Use when it counts:**
  - Illustration/icon: customer holding product box + phone with big green tick.
  - AI prompt:  
    > “Flat illustration of a customer holding a product box in one hand and a smartphone showing a big green check mark in the other, standing at a store returns counter. Minimal, modern style, white background with soft gradients.”

### 6.3 Animation

Use Framer Motion:

- When the section enters viewport, each step card slides in with a staggered delay.
- Light hover effects for each card (slight lift + shadow).

---

## 7. For Individuals, SMMEs, Retailers – Section Imagery & Motion

### 7.1 For Individuals (`#for-individuals`)

- Keep the previously specified bullets (personal receipts, reminders, proof of purchase, free).
- Layout: text left, image right on desktop; stacked on mobile.

**Image:**

- Example search/URL: person at home managing receipts on phone.  
  E.g. any image similar to:  
  `https://images.pexels.com/photos/4476376/pexels-photo-4476376.jpeg` (placeholder style).
- Alt: “Person at home managing receipts on their smartphone.”
- AI prompt:  
  > “A person relaxing on a couch at home, focusing on their smartphone. On the coffee table, there are a few neatly stacked receipts. Warm, calm environment, lifestyle photography, natural light.”

**Objects:**

- Faint calendar icon with a highlighted date.
- Background pattern of subtle receipt outlines.

**Animation:**

- Fade-in/slide-in from left/right when scrolled into view.

---

### 7.2 For SMMEs (`#for-businesses`)

- Keep the bullets (Business vs Personal profiles, staff uploads, VAT & expenditure summaries, exports, deadlines).

**Image:**

- Example: small team in an office or café owner with laptop & receipts.  
  Placeholder idea:  
  `https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184296/pexels-photo-3184296.jpeg`
- Alt: “Small business team reviewing finances on laptop with paperwork.”
- AI prompt:  
  > “A cafe owner behind the counter looking at a laptop screen showing financial charts, with receipts and invoices spread on the counter. Bright, inviting atmosphere, modern small business aesthetic.”

**Objects:**

- CSV/PDF download icon.
- Bar chart with upward trend.
- VAT badge (15%).

**Layout & animation:**

- Alternate layout vs Individuals (image left, text right).
- Framer Motion slide-in + slight parallax or stagger.

---

### 7.3 For Retailers (`#for-retailers`)

- Keep the intro + bullets about faster returns, less fraud, consistent policies, post-purchase insight.

**Image:**

- Example: customer at returns desk with box & phone, staff assisting.  
  Placeholder idea:  
  `https://images.pexels.com/photos/5632371/pexels-photo-5632371.jpeg`
- Alt: “Retail staff processing a customer return at a service desk.”
- AI prompt:  
  > “A busy supermarket customer service desk where a staff member in uniform is assisting a customer with a return. The customer is holding both a product box and a smartphone. Modern bright retail environment.”

**Objects:**

- QR code icon + green tick.
- Small “x → ✓” visual to suggest reduced fraud.

**Layout & animation:**

- Text + image side-by-side, swapping sides from previous section for visual rhythm.
- Slide/fade in on scroll.

Use Tailwind for spacing, subtle gradients, and Framer Motion for entrance effects.

---

## 8. Pricing Integration (Use Existing Pricing Section)

**Do not rebuild pricing.**

- Detect where pricing currently lives:
  - If it’s a dedicated route `/pricing`, ensure:
    - Sidebar “Pricing” navigates to `/pricing`.
    - Hero “View Business Plans” and SMMEs “See Business Plans” buttons also go to `/pricing`.
  - If pricing is an in-page section (e.g. `id="pricing"` on the landing), ensure:
    - Sidebar “Pricing” and relevant buttons scroll smoothly to `#pricing`.

Use smooth scrolling (e.g. `scrollIntoView` or a small helper) for anchor-based navigation.

---

## 9. Help & Contact Section (Keep but Style & Animate)

Keep the same content and links:

- WhatsApp:  
  `https://wa.me/27836784884?text=Hi%20SlipSafe%2C%20I%27d%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20your%20app.`
- Email:  
  `mailto:sales@slip-safe.net`
- Phone:  
  `tel:+27836784884`
- Mention live chat.

### Visuals:

- Use a light background, e.g. soft gradient.
- Add an image of a friendly, diverse support team.

  - Example placeholder image:  
    `https://images.pexels.com/photos/8867431/pexels-photo-8867431.jpeg`
  - Alt: “Friendly customer support team with headsets at computers.”
  - AI prompt:  
    > “A diverse customer support team sitting at computers wearing headsets, smiling and looking approachable, bright office environment, clean modern support imagery.”

- Each contact method (WhatsApp, Email, Phone, Chat) in its own card with icon:
  - WhatsApp → WhatsApp bubble icon.
  - Email → envelope icon.
  - Phone → handset icon.
  - Live chat → chat bubble with three dots and a subtle pulse animation.

### Animation:

- Fade-in from bottom as the section enters the viewport.
- Hover/click states on cards (scale, shadow, outline).

---

## 10. Live Chat Widget (Crisp/Tawk – keep)

If not already present, keep or add the third-party chat widget (Crisp or Tawk.to) so:

- A floating bubble appears bottom-right.
- It works on landing, login, and pricing pages.
- Ensure no conflicts with new layout.

---

## 11. Background Motifs (Global Visuals)

Add subtle background motifs for cohesion (non-blocking, decorative):

- Light grey line icons of:
  - Receipts
  - Shields with check marks
  - Calendars
  - Small data dots / lines

These can be created as a tiny repeated SVG or background pattern.

Optional AI prompt (for pattern):

> “A seamless pattern of light grey line icons: receipts, shields with check marks, calendars, and small data dots, on a white background, super subtle and minimal, suitable as a fintech webpage background.”

Use low opacity so text remains fully readable.

---

## 12. Sidebar + Layout Responsiveness

Ensure:

- Sidebar + hero + sections look good on:
  - Mobile (small screens),
  - Tablet,
  - Desktop.
- The main content shifts right when the sidebar is expanded on desktop.
- On mobile, content stays full-width; sidebar overlays as a drawer.

Use Tailwind breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) and flex/grid layouts.

---

## 13. PWA Icon & Dummy User Count (Preserve)

- Keep the existing PWA manifest + icons using the SlipSafe logo for install/add-to-home; do not remove previous configuration.
- Maintain the dummy user count constant and its animation in the hero.

---

## 14. Final Checks

After implementing the visual/interactive upgrades:

- All existing routes (login, register, pricing, etc.) still work.
- All anchors (`#how-it-works`, `#for-individuals`, `#for-businesses`, `#for-retailers`, `#help`) scroll correctly.
- Sidebar opens/closes smoothly and doesn’t hide essential content.
- All images are responsive and have meaningful `alt` text.
- External image URLs are used as placeholders and can be swapped for production assets later.
- Animations are smooth and not overwhelming (respect `prefers-reduced-motion` if feasible).
- The app builds and runs without TypeScript or bundler errors.

Now, scan the current landing page component(s) and refactor them according to this spec: add a retractable sidebar, diverse stock imagery with the prompts above, animations, and interactivity while keeping existing pricing integration and functionality intact.

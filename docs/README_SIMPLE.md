## What is SlipSafe?

SlipSafe is a simple, powerful app that helps you manage all your receipts in one place. Whether you're an individual trying to keep track of purchases or a business managing expenses, SlipSafe makes it easy to:

- **Snap a photo** of any receipt and have it automatically read and saved
- **Never miss a return deadline** with automatic reminders
- **Keep warranty information** safe and accessible
- **Generate proof of purchase** when you need to return something
- **Track business expenses** and VAT for tax purposes

Think of it as a smart filing cabinet for your receipts that lives on your phone - but one that actually reads your receipts, remembers important dates, and reminds you before it's too late to return something.

## How Does It Work?

### Step 1: Capture Your Receipt

You have three ways to add a receipt:

1. **Take a Photo** - Use your phone's camera to snap a picture of the receipt
2. **Upload a File** - Upload a photo or PDF from your device
3. **Paste Email Receipt** - Copy and paste the text from an email receipt

### Step 2: SlipSafe Reads It For You

Our smart scanning technology (powered by Google's advanced AI) automatically extracts:
- **Store name** - Where you shopped
- **Date** - When you made the purchase
- **Total amount** - How much you spent
- **VAT** - Tax information (for business users)
- **Invoice number** - The receipt reference
- **Return policy** - How long you have to return items
- **Warranty period** - How long products are covered

### Step 3: Review and Save

Check that everything looks correct (you can make changes if needed), then save. That's it!

### Step 4: Get Reminders

SlipSafe will notify you:
- Before your return window closes
- When warranties are about to expire
- About any upcoming deadlines

## Key Features Explained

### Smart Receipt Scanning

Just point your camera at a receipt and SlipSafe does the hard work. It uses Google's latest AI technology to read even faded or crumpled receipts. The system works with:
- Till slips from shops
- Restaurant bills
- Online order confirmations
- Email receipts
- PDF invoices

**Quality Tips for Best Results:**
- Good lighting helps a lot
- Keep the receipt flat
- Make sure all text is visible in the photo
- Use the flash in dim conditions

### Automatic Policy Detection

SlipSafe is smart enough to spot store policies printed on receipts. It understands phrases like:
- "30 day return policy"
- "Exchange only - no refunds"
- "12 month warranty"
- "No refunds without original receipt"

This means you always know exactly what you can do if something goes wrong with your purchase.

### Return Deadline Tracking

For every receipt, SlipSafe calculates when your return window closes and shows you:
- How many days you have left
- A countdown for upcoming deadlines
- Colour-coded warnings (green = plenty of time, yellow = running out, red = urgent)

### Warranty Management

Electronics, appliances, and other items often come with warranties. SlipSafe:
- Records warranty periods automatically
- Calculates when coverage ends
- Reminds you before warranties expire
- Stores proof of purchase for warranty claims

### Verifiable Claims

When you need to return something, SlipSafe creates a digital claim that includes:
- A **QR code** that the shop can scan
- A **6-digit PIN** for security
- All the purchase details
- Proof that you bought the item

You can share this via WhatsApp, email, or just show your phone screen at the counter.

### Personal vs Business Mode

If you have a business account, you can switch between two modes:

**Personal Mode**
- Track your personal shopping
- Simple view without tax details
- Perfect for everyday purchases

**Business Mode**
- Track business expenses
- See VAT breakdowns
- Generate tax reports
- Share with team members

Your personal and business receipts stay completely separate.
